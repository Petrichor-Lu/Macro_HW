### **1 Problem 1 (50 points) **

Use the dataset PS1.csv for this question. You may assume that the frequency is annual
```{r}
data <- read.csv("/Users/terrylu/Desktop/UF/Courses/2024-2025/2025_Spring/Macro/Problem_Set_1/PS1.csv")
str(data)
head(data)
```

```{r}
#switch the data to be time series format
y <- ts(data$y)
```

#### (i) (10 points) Calculate the first 10 autocorrelations and plot the coefficients you obtain. Is the process weakly stationary?
Normally, we calculate the autocorrelations following  the quitions:
```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("/Users/terrylu/Desktop/UF/Courses/2024-2025/2025_Spring/Macro/Problem_Set_1/Pics/1.1.jpeg")
```
Howeverm, R has a convinient package can simply calculate the ACF.
```{r}
print("Table 1: The First 10 Autocorrelations:")
print(acf_values)

acf_values <- acf(y, lag.max = 10, main = "Figure 1 ACF of y (10 Lags)", col = "blue", lwd = 2)  #calculate the autocorelation function (ACF)
```
Now we have the Table 1: The First 10 Autocorrelations and Figure 1: ACF of y (10 Lags).

Let follow the definition of Weakly Stationary to check:

1) Its unconditional expectation is constant: E[Yt] = Î¼ for all t. 





In addition, we can also use ADF Test(Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test) to test if it exists the unit root to test if it is weakly stationary:
```{r}
# ADF Test( Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test)
adf_test <- adf.test(y)
print(adf_test)
```
Since the P-Value > 5% or even 10%, we cannot reject the hypothesis (it has the unit root), so its not weakly stationary. This test boost our result above.
